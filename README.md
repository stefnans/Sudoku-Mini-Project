# Sudoku-Mini-Project
A simple sudoku game sinple page application, implemented with a Spring boot backend to handle the game turns and validation, and an Angular frontent just to get a hands-on the Angular framework .

## Launch Sudoku
To launch the sudoku on a web browser, we've simplified the task so that you only have to run the launch script `launch_sudoku.sh` and go to your favourite browser on `localhost:4200/` and there you can see the game. (Make sure you have all the required tools on your command line tool e.g. mvn and ng).
